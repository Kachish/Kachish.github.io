							<h3>The Problem and The Goal</h3>
							<p>The T-flex project addresses the critical challenges faced by the delivery service industry in
Africa, including limited access to technology, high operational costs, and fierce competition.
								<br> These obstacles make it difficult for companies to offer reliable and affordable services.
Recognizing the growing market and the high demand for delivery solutions, T-flex aims to
provide a comprehensive, flexible, and cost-effective delivery service. <br> The project's goal is to
deliver an all-rounded solution that leverages advanced technology to ensure efficiency,
affordability, and high user satisfaction, setting a new standard in the African delivery service

							<h3>User Research Pillars</h3>
							<p>User research for the T-flex project is structured around four essential pillars to ensure the
delivery service aligns with business objectives and user needs. <br> The first pillar, Business
Goals, focuses on positioning FLEX as a competitive and innovative solution in the African
market. The second pillar, Project Scope, defines the boundaries and extent of T-flex
functionalities, MVP features, and user interactions. <br> The third pillar, User Persona, involves
gaining insights into user behaviors, motivations, preferences, and challenges. <br> The fourth
pillar, Pain Point Validation, ensures the product addresses user needs, enhances
satisfaction, and boosts engagement. This rigorous research approach ensures a
transformative delivery service experience.</p>

								<h4><i class="icon-user"></i>Pain Points</h4>
								<p>The T-flex project identifies and addresses key pain points to enhance the delivery service
experience. <br> Pain Point 1 highlights the cumbersome and time-consuming process for
senders, leading to delays. <br> Pain Point 2 addresses the limited job opportunities for delivery
personnel, resulting in inconsistent income. <br> Pain Point 3 points out the limited access to
technology, making it difficult for both senders and delivery personnel to track deliveries and
place orders conveniently. <br> Pain Point 4 focuses on the lack of real-time tracking capabilities,
which challenges users in monitoring and choosing suitable delivery options. <br> By tackling
these issues, T-flex aims to streamline operations and improve user satisfaction.

							<h3>Lo-Fi & Mi-Fi Usability Test Summary</h3>
							<p>Insight-Driven Enhancements**
Through rigorous usability testing of low-fidelity and mid-fidelity prototypes, invaluable
insights were gathered to refine the T-Flex app. <br> The usability tests aimed to evaluate how
easily users could complete specified tasks, the clarity and effectiveness of task instructions,
and gather participants' feedback and suggestions. <br> Key improvements included streamlining
the sender/delivery screens by consolidating all relevant details onto a single screen to
enhance user experience and reduce loading times. <br> The sender's side credit card section
was redesigned to include a more user-friendly interface for inputting credit card details.
								<br> Additionally, implementing an M-Pesa SDK push for payments and incorporating a wallet
and dashboard for the delivery side were crucial enhancements. <br> These changes, guided by
user feedback, ensure the app meets the highest standards of functionality and user
satisfaction. </p>
